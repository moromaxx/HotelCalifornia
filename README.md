Implementation of "Object Oriented Programming" style in C language

In this project I've implemented the simple program for managing hotel that has 4 functions:
1) Show hotel status - showing status of each room in the hotel (if the room is free, and if not, how many guests are checked in and how many guests will eat breakfast)
2) Add customer - adding the customer to the hotel system
3) Check in - doing the check in to the choosen customer (from the existing customers), searching for the free room, and reserved it
4) Check out - doing the check out to the choosen room

The profect consists of the next files:
Room.c/.h
Customer.c/.h
Reservation.c/.h
Hotel.c/.h
main.c

Each file represented the typedef struct (instance of object in object oriented languages) and contains it's functional.
